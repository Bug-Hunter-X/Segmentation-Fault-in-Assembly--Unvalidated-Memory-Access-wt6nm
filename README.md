# Assembly Code Bug: Potential Segmentation Fault

This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: accessing memory outside the allocated address space.  The `mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]` instruction is vulnerable to this if `ecx` is not properly initialized or contains an unexpectedly large value, causing a segmentation fault.  The solution provides a method to safeguard against this.
